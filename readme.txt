Croice helps bloggers to create and share interactive audio streams or webinars that attract and engage audiences.

== Description ==

Bloggers are always looking for new ways to attract and retain audiences. Croice solves this problem through advanced interactive sharing.
You create your own radio channel and share your personal widget through social networks, your blog, or virtually any other web site.
The widget is used to announce broadcasts and communicate with the audience. The widget automatically updates the audience of the upcoming broadcasts.
When there is time, you start broadcasting, and all the widgets go live.
Listeners can listen to, comment, and call up the broadcaster live.
You can use it for webinars too. All you need is attach Slideshare presentation link and slide will attach and synchronized with your listeners widget.

== Feathers: ==
= Advanced sharing =
When you share your widget, you share the full functional terminal to listen your show, comments and even call to air! All widgets are synchronized and update in real time, so when you will announce your next show you donâ€™t need to share your widget again and again to the same places.
Interactive live broadcasting
You broadcast live and your listeners can communicate with you and between each other through the chat or call (through the CROICE) and chat to broadcaster right on air.
= Webinars ready =
With CROICE you can spend webinars right on your blog for free. Just attach Slideshare link and your listeners will see the same slide as you see.
